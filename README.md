# Personal Career Portfolio Website

This project is the submission for my Front-End Development CA2 assignment from Singapore Polytechnic AY22/23. 
This website consists of a home page detailing information about myself (probably outdated information), a school page which explains more about the courses offered under Singapore Polytechnic School of Computing, a career page which consists of the careers that I am considering looking for once I enter the workforce, and a feedback form which does not work.

This is by far my most favourite front end design I had ever made even after a few more front end projects for the next few semesters, and thus will be used as an inspiration for my personal website.
